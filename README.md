# Description
Object Oriented Programming and unit testing were the focus of this unit. The goal of this project was to create a Node.js command-line application that collects information on software engineering team members and generates an HTML webpage that displays the data entered by the user. Constructors and Classes were used to generate the employee objects, which was one of the application's requirements. The Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes were among them. In addition to developing the application, this project necessitated the usage of Jest and Inquirer to run unit tests on every component of the code to ensure that it passed each test. Below is a demonstration of the node application and testing.
